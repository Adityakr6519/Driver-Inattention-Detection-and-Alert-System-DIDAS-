# Driver-Inattention-Detection-and-Alert-System-DIDAS-
This a project build on CNN to detect if driver is inattentive during driving and an alarm system to alarm driver.
The DIDAS.ipynb contains code for building and testing 3 models and comparing them(along with preprocessing and other info)
The driver_model.sav contains the saved model file of the best accuracy model among the 3.
Revistone-5classes contains data (images) for training and evaluating purpose sorted in 5 categories
Finally Prototype.ipyn contains the prototype of the model where you can test the model for youself using your laptop cameras
I have used python and its libraries for this project and the dataset from Kaggle.
Recommendation: Use jpyter notebook to open the .ipyn files
